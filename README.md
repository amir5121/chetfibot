Just goofing around it i when you are seeing this i might have it up and running you can check it out https://t.me/chetfibot

also if you want to run it yourself you need to download `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` 

at the moment it does 2 things one laying out images which is rubbish
second thing it does that is less rubbish it tries to find face in the given images and find the place 
between two eyes and scale and transform and rotate the image in such a way that align all eyes in all images
